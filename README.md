# 🖼️ ASCII Image Converter

Convert your images into ASCII art using Python and Pillow!

## 📜 Description

This Python script takes an image (`dogs.jpg` by default), converts it to grayscale, and maps each pixel to an ASCII character based on its brightness. 
The result is saved as a text file (`ascii-image.txt`) that visually represents the image using ASCII symbols.

The script uses 30 levels of shading with `'░▒▓'` characters to create a grayscale gradient.
